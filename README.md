Boolflix uses the [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to fetch data about movies and TV shows. The application makes requests to the `search/movie` & `search/tv` endpoints of the API to get movies and TV shows based on the user's search query.
